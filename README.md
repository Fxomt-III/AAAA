# AAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA language.

made by a very bored programmer.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA compiles to brainf\*ck, and can compile brainf\*ck to AAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

It is recommended to use [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) for speedups, the performance with cpython is extremely slow, so pypy makes it faster, but you can still run it with Cpython.

# How to use

```
<Interpreter> A.py <FILE>.AAA # To run AAA files
<Interpreter> A.py comp <FILE>.bf # to compile brainf*ck files
```
Replace interpreter with your favorite python interpreter, ie, pypy, cpython, etc..
