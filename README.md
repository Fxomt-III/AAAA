# AAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA language.

made by a very bored programmer.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAA compiles to brainf\*ck, and can compile brainf\*ck to AAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

It is recommended to use [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) for speedups, the performance with cpython is extremely slow, so pypy makes it faster, but you can still run it with Cpython.



# How it works
it compiles AAA to brainf\*ck, then interprets that brainf\*ck using this [Interpreter](https://github.com/pocmo/Python-Brainfuck) made by pocmo.

# How to use

first, compile your brainf\*ck file to AAA using 

```
<Interpreter> A.py comp <FILE>.bf # to compile brainf*ck files to AAA files
```

then, run the compiled file using:
```
<Interpreter> A.py <FILE>.AAA # To run AAA files
```
Replace interpreter with your favorite python interpreter, ie, pypy, cpython, etc..
